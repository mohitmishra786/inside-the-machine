## Introduction

This is a sample chapter that demonstrates how to format your chapter content for the Jekyll website. Each chapter should be created as a Markdown file in the `_chapters` directory with the appropriate front matter.

## Main Content

Your chapter content goes here. You can use all standard Markdown formatting:

### Subheadings

Use subheadings to organize your content.

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are styled with syntax highlighting:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, Reverse Engineering!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Assembly code example:

```assembly
section .text
global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 4          ; sys_write system call
    mov ebx, 1          ; stdout file descriptor
    mov ecx, message    ; message to write
    mov edx, 13         ; message length
    int 0x80            ; call kernel
    
    mov eax, 1          ; sys_exit system call
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit code 0
    int 0x80            ; call kernel

section .data
message: db "Hello, World!", 0x0A
```

### Lists

You can use ordered and unordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two
- Bullet point three

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It can be used for important notes or quotes from other sources.

### Images

If you need to include images, place them in the `assets/images` directory and reference them like this:

```markdown
![Image description](/assets/images/example.png)
```

## Practical Exercises

You can include practical exercises at the end of each chapter:

1. **Basic Exercise**: Description of a simple exercise for beginners.
2. **Intermediate Exercise**: A more challenging task for those with some experience.
3. **Advanced Exercise**: A complex problem for advanced readers.
